# Notes: Agile Project Management and Tools to Help

I want to introduce the idea of agile project management. In order to do this I would like to be able to thoroughly explain its implementation in a software development context first. This will begin with a clear definition of what agile is and what was popular before the agile approach to projects namely the "Waterfall" approach.

Agile vs. waterfall

- product rather than a project mindset
- Waterfall can be seen as the more traditional mindset towards projects where all the requirements are gathered up front. Project phases proceed sequentially from one step to the next. Changes in project scope are unwelcomed and not easily accounted for unless starting from the beginning once more.

- Agile can be seen as a more flexible approach towards project management where changes to original project scope are welcomed and anticipated. 

- Waterfall techniques are best suited for small projects with easily defined scope (small tools, very specifically targeted software)

- Agile is better for projects with changing scopes and projects where all information is not known beforehand (usability issues, changing software requirements)

More about Waterfall

Waterfall management style was the de facto means of managing software projects until projects became too big and suffered under the rigid inflexible nature of this project management style.
